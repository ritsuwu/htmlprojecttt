<p2> im a dumb freshman, and go by a dumb anime boy name (dont ask). my best/favorie subjects are art, english, and science, but i do enjoy history and computers/coding as well. i spend most of my time drawing, in school and out. if im not drawing however i like to play videogames like monster hunter, pokemon, etc. If you couldnt tell, i love mob psycho 100 and a few other shows like kill la kill. my All Time favorite character would have to be Shou Suzuki from mp100, but i love almost everyone from the show. one thing that does top him although is bats. just bats. i love bats. so much. Bats? Perfect. </p2>
